  <h1>Sexual Immorality is a <b>BIG NO NO</b> in Scripture</h1>
  
  <blockquote><b>But sexual immorality and all [moral] impurity [indecent, offensive behavior] or greed must not even be hinted at among you, as is proper among saints [for as believers our way of life, whether in public or in private, reflects the validity of our faith]</b>. Let there be no filthiness and silly talk, or coarse [obscene or vulgar] joking, because such things are not appropriate [for believers]; but instead speak of your thankfulness [to God]. <b>For be sure of this: no immoral, impure, or greedy person--for that one is [in effect] an idolater--has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God [for such a person places a higher value on something other than God]</b>. <em>Let no one deceive you with empty arguments [that encourage you to sin]</em>, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience [those who habitually sin]. <b>So do not participate or even associate with them [in the rebelliousness of sin]</b>. For once you were darkness, but now you are Light in the Lord; walk as children of Light [live as those who are native-born to the Light]

      <p>Everything is permissible for me, but not all things are beneficial. <b>Everything is permissible for me, but I will not be enslaved by anything [and brought under its power, allowing it to control me]</b>. Food is for the stomach and the stomach for food, but God will do away with both of them. The body <b>is not intended</b> for sexual immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord is for the body [to save, sanctify, and raise it again because of the sacrifice of the cross]. And God has not only raised the Lord [to life], but will also raise us up by His power. <b>Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ</b>? Am I therefore to take the members of Christ and make them part of a prostitute? Certainly not! Do you not know that the one who joins himself to a prostitute is one body with her? For He says, “T he two shall be one flesh .” But the one who is united and joined to the Lord is one spirit with Him . <b>Run away from sexual immorality [in any form, whether thought or behavior, whether visual or written]</b>. Every other sin that a man commits is outside the body, <b>but the one who is sexually immoral sins against his own body</b>. Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who is within you, whom you have [received as a gift] from God, and that you are not your own [property]? You were bought with a price [you were actually purchased with the precious blood of Jesus and made His own]. So then, honor and glorify God with your body.
