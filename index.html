    <h1>Sexual Immorality is a <b>BIG NO NO</b> in Scripture</h1>
    
    <blockquote><b>But sexual immorality and all [moral] impurity [indecent, offensive behavior] or greed must not even be hinted at among you, as is proper among saints [for as believers our way of life, whether in public or in private, reflects the validity of our faith]</b>. Let there be no filthiness and silly talk, or coarse [obscene or vulgar] joking, because such things are not appropriate [for believers]; but instead speak of your thankfulness [to God]. <b>For be sure of this: no immoral, impure, or greedy person--for that one is [in effect] an idolater--has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God [for such a person places a higher value on something other than God]</b>. <em>Let no one deceive you with empty arguments [that encourage you to sin]</em>, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience [those who habitually sin]. <b>So do not participate or even associate with them [in the rebelliousness of sin]</b>. For once you were darkness, but now you are Light in the Lord; walk as children of Light [live as those who are native-born to the Light]

    <p>For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us not to place on you any greater burden than these essentials:  that you abstain from things sacrificed to idols, and from [consuming] blood, and from [eating the meat of] things that have been strangled, and from sexual impurity. If you keep yourselves from these things, you will do well. Farewell.”

    <p>Therefore it is my judgment that we do not trouble and make it difficult for those who are turning to God among the Gentiles [by putting obstacles in their way], but that we write to them that they are to <b>abstain from</b> anything that has been contaminated by [being offered to] idols and from <b>sexual impurity</b> and from [eating the meat of] what has been strangled and from [the consumption of] blood.
